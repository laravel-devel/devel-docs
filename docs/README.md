# About Devel

Devel (a **DEV**eloper's Larav**EL**) enhances Laravel in different ways making life of Laravel developers easier.

The Devel's main goal is to solve some of the common problems, minimize the routine of the development process, give projects a better structure. Devel can be used to develop regular web sites, as well as APIs/backends for Web Apps / PWAs / Mobile Apps. It comes with an admin dashboard too!

## Features

This it what Devel adds to a Laravel project:
- Modularity:
    - Organize your code into reusable modules.
    - Install modules made by other people.
    - Artisan commands to generate files and code for you modules
- User roles and permissions system.
- An extensible admin dashboard built with custom Vue.js components.
    - The dashboard is a module itself, which you can disable like any other module if you don't need it.
    - Extending the dashboard is super easy. To add a new dashboard page you just need to define a new dashboard route anywhere in your project.
- A CRUD generator for the dashboard
    - There's no visual CRUD or DB schema editor out of the box. This is not WordPress and you're not a content editor.
    - The generator is an artisan command that generates CRUD scaffolding code (a controller, views, and more). You can edit the code however you need. For simpler cases the generated code might even be enough as it is!
- A set of tools and utilities solving some common problems:
    - SEO tools to easily add meta tags to your page
    - ... more to come!

## Project Status

**TRIAL AND ERROR STAGE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!** The project is in its early active development stage. The dashboard/CRUD is incomplete and there are no any ready-to-use modules yet. Besides, breaking changes are made quite often.
